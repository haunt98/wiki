> Note that Redis uses gettimeofday, not a monotonic clock, to determine the
> expiry of keys. The man page for gettimeofday explicitly says that the time it
> returns is subject to discontinuous jumps in system time – that is, it might
> suddenly jump forwards by a few minutes, or even jump back in time
>
> If you need locks only on a best-effort basis (as an efficiency optimization,
> not for correctness), I would recommend sticking with the straightforward
> single-node locking algorithm for Redis (conditional set-if-not-exists to
> obtain a lock, atomic delete-if-value-matches to release a lock), and
> documenting very clearly in your code that the locks are only approximate and
> may occasionally fail. Don’t bother with setting up a cluster of five Redis
> nodes.

> Use of internal and external ids

> It is generally a good practice to not expose your primary keys to the
> external world. This is especially important when you use sequential
> auto-incrementing identifiers with type integer or bigint since they are
> guessable.

[The part of PostgreSQL we hate the most](https://ottertune.com/blog/the-part-of-postgresql-we-hate-the-most)

> The core idea of PostgreSQL’s MVCC scheme is seemingly straightforward: when a
> query updates an existing row in a table, the DBMS makes a copy of that row
> and applies the changes to this new version instead of overwriting the
> original row.

[Why Uber Engineering Switched from Postgres to MySQL](https://www.uber.com/en-VN/blog/postgres-to-mysql-migration/)

> - Inefficient architecture for writes
> - Inefficient data replication
> - Issues with table corruption
> - Poor replica MVCC support
> - Difficulty upgrading to newer releases
>
> With Postgres, the primary index and secondary indexes all point directly to
> the on-disk tuple offsets. When a tuple location changes, all indexes must be
> updated.

Life without WAL.

The problem: Updating the on-disk data structures is costly, performance-wise.
Firstly, finding the OS page where the record/index entry is stored translates
to random IO. Secondly, to ensure 100% durability, one would have to ensure that
the file changes are actually synced to disk, and not just living in the OS/disk
cache, which is again, not free of cost. See fsync!

Without WAL: CRUD database → wait to sync to disk → another CRUD

With WAL:

- CRUD database → another CRUD → … → write to log
- Another process get from log → sync to disk

WAL: enable replication

```sql
PRAGMA journal_mode = WAL;
PRAGMA busy_timeout = 5000;
PRAGMA synchronous = NORMAL;
PRAGMA cache_size = 1000000000;
PRAGMA foreign_keys = true;
PRAGMA temp_store = memory;
