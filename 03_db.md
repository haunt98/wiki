> The isolation levels mentioned in the SQL standard are:
>
> - Serializable (most strict, expensive): A serializable execution produces the
>   same effect as some serial execution of those transactions. A serial
>   execution is one in which each transaction executes to completion before the
>   next transaction begins. One note about Serializable level is that it is
>   often implemented as “snapshot isolation” (e.g. Oracle) due to differences
>   in interpretation and “snapshot isolation” is not represented in the SQL
>   standard.
> - Repeatable reads: Uncommitted reads in the current transaction are visible
>   to the current transaction but changes made by other transactions (such as
>   newly inserted rows) won’t be visible.
> - Read committed: Uncommitted reads are not visible to the transactions. Only
>   committed writes are visible but the phantom reads may happen. If another
>   transaction inserts and commits new rows, the current transaction can see
>   them when querying.
> - Read uncommitted (least strict, cheap): Dirty reads are allowed,
>   transactions can see not-yet-committed changes made by other transactions.
>   In practice, this level could be useful to return approximate aggregates,
>   such as COUNT(*) queries on a table.

## Redis

[How to do distributed locking](https://martin.kleppmann.com/2016/02/08/how-to-do-distributed-locking.html)
vs [Is Redlock safe?](http://antirez.com/news/101)

> Note that Redis uses gettimeofday, not a monotonic clock, to determine the
> expiry of keys. The man page for gettimeofday explicitly says that the time it
> returns is subject to discontinuous jumps in system time – that is, it might
> suddenly jump forwards by a few minutes, or even jump back in time
>
> If you need locks only on a best-effort basis (as an efficiency optimization,
> not for correctness), I would recommend sticking with the straightforward
> single-node locking algorithm for Redis (conditional set-if-not-exists to
> obtain a lock, atomic delete-if-value-matches to release a lock), and
> documenting very clearly in your code that the locks are only approximate and
> may occasionally fail. Don’t bother with setting up a cluster of five Redis
> nodes.

> Use of internal and external ids

> It is generally a good practice to not expose your primary keys to the
> external world. This is especially important when you use sequential
> auto-incrementing identifiers with type integer or bigint since they are
> guessable.

[The part of PostgreSQL we hate the most](https://ottertune.com/blog/the-part-of-postgresql-we-hate-the-most)

> The core idea of PostgreSQL’s MVCC scheme is seemingly straightforward: when a
> query updates an existing row in a table, the DBMS makes a copy of that row
> and applies the changes to this new version instead of overwriting the
> original row.

[Why Uber Engineering Switched from Postgres to MySQL](https://www.uber.com/en-VN/blog/postgres-to-mysql-migration/)

> - Inefficient architecture for writes
> - Inefficient data replication
> - Issues with table corruption
> - Poor replica MVCC support
> - Difficulty upgrading to newer releases
>
> With Postgres, the primary index and secondary indexes all point directly to
> the on-disk tuple offsets. When a tuple location changes, all indexes must be
> updated.

## Kafka

[Kafka: Design](https://kafka.apache.org/documentation.html#design)

[The Log: What every software engineer should know about real-time data's unifying abstraction](https://engineering.linkedin.com/distributed-systems/log-what-every-software-engineer-should-know-about-real-time-datas-unifying)

> A log is perhaps the simplest possible storage abstraction. It is an
> append-only, totally-ordered sequence of records ordered by time. It looks
> like this:
>
> Records are appended to the end of the log, and reads proceed left-to-right.
> Each entry is assigned a unique sequential log entry number.
>
> Over-time the usage of the log grew from an implementation detail of ACID to a
> method for replicating data between databases. It turns out that the sequence
> of changes that happened on the database is exactly what is needed to keep a
> remote replica database in sync. Oracle, MySQL, and PostgreSQL include log
> shipping protocols to transmit portions of log to replica databases which act
> as slaves.
>
> The two problems a log solves—ordering changes and distributing data—are even
> more important in distributed data systems.
>
> We used a few tricks in Kafka to support this kind of scale:
>
> - Partitioning the log
> - Optimizing throughput by batching reads and writes
> - Avoiding needless data copies
>
> Each partition is a totally ordered log, but there is no global ordering
> between partitions (other than perhaps some wall-clock time you might include
> in your messages). The assignment of the messages to a particular partition is
> controllable by the writer, with most users choosing to partition by some kind
> of key (e.g. user id). Partitioning allows log appends to occur without
> co-ordination between shards and allows the throughput of the system to scale
> linearly with the Kafka cluster size.
>
> Each partition is replicated across a configurable number of replicas, each of
> which has an identical copy of the partition's log. At any time, a single one
> of them will act as the leader; if the leader fails, one of the replicas will
> take over as leader.
>
> Lack of a global order across partitions is a limitation, but we have not
> found it to be a major one. Indeed, interaction with the log typically comes
> from hundreds or thousands of distinct processes so it is not meaningful to
> talk about a total order over their behavior. Instead, the guarantees that we
> provide are that each partition is order preserving, and Kafka guarantees that
> appends to a particular partition from a single sender will be delivered in
> the order they are sent.
>
> A log, like a filesystem, is easy to optimize for linear read and write
> patterns. The log can group small reads and writes together into larger,
> high-throughput operations. Kafka pursues this optimization aggressively.
> Batching occurs from client to server when sending data, in writes to disk, in
> replication between servers, in data transfer to consumers, and in
> acknowledging committed data.
>
> Finally, Kafka uses a simple binary format that is maintained between
> in-memory log, on-disk log, and in network data transfers. This allows us to
> make use of numerous optimizations including zero-copy data transfer.
>
> Second, the log provides buffering to the processes. This is very fundamental.
> If processing proceeds in an unsynchronized fashion it is likely to happen
> that an upstream data producing job will produce data more quickly than
> another downstream job can consume it. When this occurs processing must block,
> buffer or drop data. Dropping data is likely not an option; blocking may cause
> the entire processing graph to grind to a halt. The log acts as a very, very
> large buffer that allows process to be restarted or fail without slowing down
> other parts of the processing graph. This isolation is particularly important
> when extending this data flow to a larger organization, where processing is
> happening by jobs made by many different teams. We cannot have one faulty job
> cause back-pressure that stops the entire processing flow.

Life without WAL.

The problem: Updating the on-disk data structures is costly, performance-wise.
Firstly, finding the OS page where the record/index entry is stored translates
to random IO. Secondly, to ensure 100% durability, one would have to ensure that
the file changes are actually synced to disk, and not just living in the OS/disk
cache, which is again, not free of cost. See fsync!

Without WAL: CRUD database → wait to sync to disk → another CRUD

With WAL:

- CRUD database → another CRUD → … → write to log
- Another process get from log → sync to disk

WAL: enable replication
